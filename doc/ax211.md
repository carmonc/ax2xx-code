The AX211 isn't well documented.  This aims to fix that.

Memory Areas
============

The 8051 has two different kinds of areas, each of which is further
subdivided:

* IRAM - located on-chip.  256 bytes in total.  Accessed using "mov"
instruction.
    * IRAM address 0-7 corresponds to CPU registers R0-R7
    * IRAM address 8-0x7f are on-chip RAM
    * IRAM address 0x80-0xff are Special Function Registers (SFRs).  See
    below.

* XRAM - 16 kilobytes of "External" RAM.  Accessed by storing an address in
DPTR (which is really made up of SFR 0x82 and 0x83, called DPL and DPH
respectively) and either loading to the accumulator using "movx A, @DPTR" or
storing from the accumulator using "movx @DPTR, A".
    * 0x0000 - 0x0006 is reserved somehow.  Contains 0x51 0x00 0x00 0x00 ...
    * 0x0007 - 0x01ff is protected and returns 0xff.  The CPU and NAND
                      block can't read this range, but the SD block can.
    * 0x0200 - 0x2002 is interrupt vector 0 (SPI)
    * 0x0203 - 0x2005 is interrupt vector 1 (other SPI)
    * 0x0206 - 0x0208 is interrupt vector 2 (NAND)
    * 0x0209 - 0x020b is interrupt vector 3 (unknown)
    * 0x020c - 0x02af is general-purpose RAM
        * Code execution for APPO factory mode begins at offset 0x2900
    * 0x2ba0 - 0x2bff contains something interesting, and I'm not sure what
    * 0x2c00 - 0x3fff is read-only and contains zeroes
    * 0x0000 - 0x3fff is mirrored at 0x4000, 0x8000, and 0xc000


Extended Opcodes
============----

The AX211 is likely similar to the AX208, which is a digital picture frame
processor from AppoTech.  A limited reference manual is available that
describes some 16-bit opcodes provided by this processor.

Unfortunately the opcodes themselves aren't described, only the mnemonics.
Fortunately, it appears as though the 8051 instruction set is listed in
opcode order (i.e. "NOP" [opcode 0x00] is listed first, followed by AJMP
[opcode 0x01] and LJMP [opcode 0x02] and so-on), so we shall assume that
the extended mnemonics are also listed in the same order.

For information on standard 8051 opcodes, see:
http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/comp/8051/set8051.html

Extended opcodes begin with the "Undefined" opcode 0xa5.  This opcode was
undefined in the original 8051, and is sometimes used by manufacturers to
provide additional instructions while retaining compatibility.

0xa5 0x90 -> register 0xc0c1 is xored with 0xc8c9 and stored in 0xc0c1

0xa5 0x91 -> clear register ER2

0x10 -> NOT C0C1
0x11 -> CLR C0C1
0x14 -> NOT C8C9
0x15 -> CLR C8C9

DPH:    Data Pointer (high)

IE:     Interrupt enable

            4 - enable/disable interrupt 4
            3 - enable/disable interrupt 3
            2 - enable/disable interrupt 2
            1 - enable/disable interrupt 1

SDOS:   SD output state.  Write a "1" here to kick off a transfer.  There appear to be extra bits that determine what sort of transfer it is.

        | ?ABC ???S |
            S = "start transfer" bit
            ABC = ? (maybe indicates 'CMD' bit?)

NFMT:  NAND setup format


SDI1..4: Register values R1..R4 from the SD command

SDCMD:  The number of the command that was sent (without start bit).  E.g. if the first byte was 0x42, then SDCMD would equal 0x02.

IACK:   Clear the appropriate bit to acknowledge an IRQ

        | xxxx 4321 |
            4 - acknowledge interrupt 4
            3 - acknowledge interrupt 3
            2 - acknowledge interrupt 2
            1 - acknowledge interrupt 1

            h = "high bit of address"

SDDL:   SD transfer source address (low byte), divided by 4

SDDH:   SD transfer source address (high byte), divided by 4

        | xxxx xDDD | (Only lower three bits are used)

SDDIR:  SD pin direction registers

PORT1:  GPIO for the NAND port.  When set to 0xff, drives pins high.

NPRE1:  Send some form of this packet as a preamble

NPRE2:  Determines whether or not to send the preamble

NTYPE:  Defines the type of NAND

        | r?aa s??? |
            s - Transfer size.  0 for 256+8 bytes, 1 for 512+16 bytes.
            a - Number of address bits. The number of ALE cycles is [AA]+2, e.g. if [AA] is 0, there will be two ALE cycles.
            r - 1 when the engine is running, 0 when it's idle

NCMD:   NAND command.  The command to send comes from this table:

        | WRA2 1CCC |
            C - Simple command, from the table below
            1 - Send an initial command byte
            2 - Add a post-address command after sending the address
            A - Send ADDRs before performing read or write
            W - Write data
            R - Read data

        Note: Setting R and W together will crash the card.  If neither is
        set, then neither a read nor a write is performed, but the command
        will still be sent.

        Note: If "A" is not set, then "2" will have no effect.

    - Simple Command Table -
     CMD | Result
     ----+-------------------------
       0 | nop
       1 | Reset: [CMD 0xff]
       2 | Read ID: [CMD 0x90] / [ADDR 0x00] / READ[8]
       3 | Read: [CMD 0x00] / [ADDRs] / READ[528]
       4 | Erase: [CMD 0x60 / [ADDRs] / [CMD 0xd0]
       5 | Write: [CMD 0x80] / [ADDRs] / WRITE[528] / [CMD 0x10]
       6 | Status: [CMD 0x70] / READ
       7 | Complex command (Use NCMD[3:7] for command description)

NRAML:  Source address for NAND transfers.  Actual address is calculated as (SFR_A3<<8+SFR_A2)*8.

NRAMH:  Source address for NAND transfers, high byte.

NCMD0:  Used in some operations as the initial command type.

NCMD1:  Used in some operations as the final command type.

NADD0..4: NAND address registers.  These define, in order, which address to specify when sending a NAND command.  These registers are reset after each NAND command that uses addresses.  For example, if you set NADD0..4 and then call NCMD6 (read status), this will not change the values of NADD0..4.
As a special case, NCMD2 (read ID) seems to store some sort of data in NADD0..4.  The data it stores is not the actual NAND ID.

ERxy:   Extended register [x], sub-byte [y].  These registers make up the four 32-bit registers that the ext_op code works on.

ER8:    8-bit "A" register used for 32-bit opcodes.

ACC:    Accumulator

B:      Scratch register.  Used for multiply/divide operations.

RAND:   Appears to be a random number (but may be a counter of some sort)


The DPL+DPH combination form the address that's read by the DPTR register.

The contents of the SFRs when the program is first loaded is:

    0c 80 02 00 00 00 00 00  00 22 5b 27 c0 00 00 00
    02 00 00 00 00 fe 00 00  10 00 00 50 00 00 01 28

    48 ff 00 2c 00 3f 00 00  14 fe ff ff 00 00 00 00


NAND Storage
============

The initial boot code is protected with a very robust error correction
algorithm.  Every 512-bytes is protected by both a 16-bit CRC16 and a
108-bit ECC of some sort (likely BCH).

At the end of a 512-byte block there will be 16 bytes of ECC data.  For
example, the following pattern was observed after a 512-byte block
consisting entirely of 0xff:

    00000200  7f a1 8e be 74 9d 5f 07  d7 f6 d1 81 12 59 5e f9 |....t._......Y^.|

Bytes 0 and 1 are the result of a CRC16 across the entire field.  The CRC16
of 512 bytes of 0xff is 0x7fa1.

Byte 2 serves dual-purpose.  The lower nybble is fixed to the value "0xe"
for reasons that are not yet clear.

The upper nybble of byte 2, along with the remaining 13 bytes are all ECC
data.
