Overview
========

This is a collection of utilities and source to work with assembly for the
AX211 SD processor.  It consists of an assembler, a utility to kick the
processor into code-load mode, and a source file to upload once it's in
code-load mode.

Assembler
---------
The assembler originally comes from https://www.pjrc.com/tech/8051/.  It is
a beta test release.  The parser.y file is pre-processed due to Bison not
functioning on the current Novena OpenEmbedded distribution.

Please report any problems to

Utility
-------

The ax211-utility is used for testing the chip.  It is also used to load and
execute code, and for working with the EIM interface.

For more information, run "./ax211 -h"


ROM File
--------

The ROM file expects to be loaded at offset 0x2900.  You're limited to 512
bytes, and you shouldn't assume anything is set up such as a stack.ROM File
